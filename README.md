# react-white-elephant

This is a work in progress, no judging.

Developed on node v16.17.1.

You will need a database named `react_white_elephant` with tables in `./server/scripts`.

To run, make sure your database is running and then run `yarn install` and `yarn start` in both the server and client folders.
